  %h4 What Is TILT?

  %p
    TILT is currently a theoretical idea about improving the
    state of education without a dramatic spending increase,
    and without relying on hero, self-sacrificing teachers to save the day.

  %h4 The Idea

  %p
    The ideas behind TILT are based around one fundamental change:
    students as student-teachers.

  %p
    TILT turns the student population in to an army of teachers,
    with older students teaching younger students
    (e.g. Three 5th graders teaching nine 4th graders), and
    younger students teaching even younger students
    (e.g. Three 4th graders teaching nine 3rd graders).

  %p
    This simple concept provides a number of benefits (described
    on the right), that have the potential to change the dynamics
    of how we think about education and the value that the students
    receive from their education.

  %p
    It's a solution that does not require billions of additional
    funding for education to find and train excellent teachers, does
    not require teachers to make significant personal sacrifices, does
    not require a war against the teacher's unions, and puts the
    students at the forefront of a solving a problem that is about the students.

      %b Teaching Is Learning Too
      %p
        Teaching another person may be one of the best ways to turn
        learning in to knowledge. In order to teach you have to
        understand the material, not simply regurgitate the material.
        Teaching also teaches communication skills, empathy, teamwork,
        creativity, and many other skills that are essential in the real world.
    %li
      %b Increased Responsibility
      %p
        Students as student-teachers means that the students are now
        responsible for the success of their school as a whole. Many
        students never get the opportunity to become a trusted, responsible,
        contributing member of a large group. TILT makes this
        happen on a daily basis.
    %li
      %b Effective Teaching
      %p
        Older students have unique insights on how best to teach students
        who are slightly younger. Having recently been through the process of
        learning from older students themselves they will have developed strategies
        and techniques for teaching. The younger kids are also more likely
        to respect someone who they look up to within the confines of the school,
        making it easier to get the younger kids excited about learning.
    %li
      %b Classroom Management
      %p
        Expecting 1 teacher to be able to manage a classroom of 18-30 students
        while also being an excellent teacher is a lot to ask, even of the best
        teachers. Having 3 older students teaching 9 younger students means that
        all three older students can be involved in teaching and classroom management
        simultaneously, a much more reasonable task.
    %li
      %b A Community
      %p
        With all students acting both as teachers as well as learners, there is
        a greater community feel, with greater opportunity for students to develop
        empathy for teachers. It even provides opportunities for learning to take
        place outside the classroom where the student-teachers have more contact
        with their students then teachers normally do.
    %li
      %b Hero's Not Required
      %p
        Most importantly TILT does not require teachers to be hero's, making personal
        sacrifices, and struggling under the momentous weight of the future of the
        children they are responsible for. Teachers are still an essential ingredient
        as the student-teachers will need considerable support as they look to
        impart accurate teaching on to the younger students, and teachers will be vital
        in helping to find the optimal ways to enable students as student-teachers while
        ensuring an excellent education is available to all students.
